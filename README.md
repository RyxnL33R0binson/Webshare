This is a social program I developer in Java. The program allows clients to sign up and connect with other users to create group chats and message each other.
Concepts include:

2. Unit tests in the JUnit framework.
3. The javax.imageio library to upload and send files two other members in the group.
4. Data stream for the server side to connect to the localhost.
5. Swing/Awt to create the graphical user interface.
6. Regex for password requriements and making sure the there aren't any invalid characters where requried (making sure there aren't any numbers in the users first and full name, making sure the email has an @ and ends in either .com or .co.uk etc.)
7. Serialisation.
8. Individualised event handling.
9. Connection class in the sql library to create a connection between the client and server side so other clients who are also running the program recieve the messages.
10. WindowListsner library so users can see the date and time of when the message was sent.
11. SQL query to pass through the users credientials to the local database and more.
